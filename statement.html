      <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <p> My name is Monica Munoz. I am a Digital arts Major. As an artist, I like to explore in new mediums, but centralize in the digital world. I think that art can be expressed in many ways as something pleasing to look at and didactic in a simultaneous manner. My work is based on making art conceptual, educational, and entertaining. For my artwork, the basis of creating art originates from the desire to see how the viewer interacts and views it.  While most of my current projects have been created through a digital sense, I do enjoy making art through the traditional manner such as painting. My methodology in each project is definitely consistent, but I do like to challenge myself to new concepts and way of creating art. The subject matter of each body of work definitely determines the materials and the forms of my work. Each project consists of multiple works in a range of different styles grouped around specific themes and meanings. During research for ideas, new areas of  interest arise and lead to future artworks. In my current project, I created a series of three glitch art images that have a reminiscence and dreamlike quality. The arrangement for the project was certainly about providing a good presentation to make a good statement of the artworks meaning.  <br>

<!-- The first video is about social media and immigration. I chose this topic because I believe that social media has become a very important source of information that if used efficiently, can be extremely beneficial. In this case, immigrants have taken advantage of social media such as facebook to get informed of what can potentially affect them. As a child of immigrant parents, I can completely relate to the hardships that many endure to be in the US. My second video is about global warming and the effects it has on our planet. This topic is something that is widely spoken about, but not much has been done about it. Since it's a subject that highly interests me, it was definitely a must to show in my video. Lastly, I enjoy coding and using technology as a way to show my artwork. Creating net art was very enjoyable to create and will absolutely be part of some of my future artworks.  </p> -->
